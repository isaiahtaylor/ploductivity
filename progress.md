# Ploductivity progress

Most of my progress will be recorded in commit messages, but anything that isn't captured there I'll capture here.

## 1/30/20
Spent 22 mins. See commits.

## 1/31/20
Cleared out content, added some lines

## 2/1/20
Created the plod type and added progress bars

## 2/5/20
Took a break and came back. Got a bit carried away today... 37 mins. Added the "new plod" page with a form and some storage.

## 3/29/20
Worked on this on and off. This sounds crazy, but I'm going to wipe everything and start over in React Native. The time has not been wasted; I've learned a good bit and solidified my vision for what I want. Here it goes!
